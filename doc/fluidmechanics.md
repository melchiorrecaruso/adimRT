where

- $p$ is the value of pressure, $[Pa]$;
- $F$ is the value of force, $[N]$;
- $S$ is the value of surface area $[m^2]$.

- $t$ is the unit of time, $[s]$;
- $A$ is the cross-sectin area, $[m^2]$;
- $v$ is the speed of fluid, $[m/s]$.

###  Air friction (air drag force)

$F_{drag}=\displaystyle -\frac {1}{2}·C_d\left( ρ·v^2 \right)·A$

- $ρ$ is the the density of the fluid, $[kg/m^3]$;
- $v$ is the speed of the object relative to the fluid, $[m/s]$;
- $A$ is the cross sectional area, $[m^2]$.

### Viscous resistance (falling sphere through a liquid)

- $\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, $[Pa⋅s]$;
- $ρ$ is the the density of the fluid, $[kg/m^3]$.

### Viscous friction (laminar flow)

$μ = \displaystyle \left(\frac {F}{A} \right)⋅ \left(\frac {\Delta y}{\Delta v}\right)$

where 
- $μ$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, $[Pa⋅s]$;
- $F$ is the is the constant force applied to the plate, $[N]$;
- $A$ is the area of each plate, $[m^2]$;
- $\Delta y$ is the height of a fluid layer, $[m]$;
- $\Delta v$ is the difference in flow velocity between adjacent fluid layers, $[m/s]$.

### Stevino's law

$p = p_0 + ρ·g·h$

where

- $p_0$ is the initial pressure, $[Pa]$;
- $ρ$ is the density of the flow, $[kg/m^3]$;
- $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $[m/s^2]$;
- $h$ where h is the height $(z − z_0)$ of the liquid column between the test volume and the zero reference point of the pressure, $[m]$. 

### Archimede's principle

$F_a = (ρ·g)·V$

where

- $F_a$ denotes the buoyant force applied onto the submerged object, $[N]$;
- $ρ$ is the the density of the fluid, $[kg/m^3]$;
- $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $[m/s^2]$;
- $V$ represents the volume of the displaced fluid, $[m^3]$.

### Bernoulli's law

$p + (ρ·g)·h + 1/2·ρ·v² = costant$

where 

- $p$ is the pressure at the chosen point, $[Pa]$;
- $ρ$ is the density of the fluid at all points in the fluid, $[kg/m^3]$;
- $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $[m/s^2]$;
- $h$ is the mean potential elevation of the section, $[m]$;
- $v$ is the fluid flow speed at a point, $[m/s]$.
