# Light and Vision

### Focal Length: sperically curved mirror

$f=\displaystyle\frac{R}{2}$ ,

where
- $f$ is the focal length $[m]$. The focal length is positive for a concave mirror and converging lens, and negative for a convex mirror and diverging  lens;
- $R$ is the radius of curvature of the mirror's surface, $[m]$;

### Thin Lens Equation

$\displaystyle\frac{1}{f}=\frac{1}{d_o}+\frac{1}{d_i}$ , 

where

- $f$ is the focal length, $[m]$;
- $d_o$ is the distance of object, $[m]$;
- $d_i$ is the distance of image, $[m]$.

### Magnification:Transverse &Angular

$M=\displaystyle-\frac{d_i}{d_o}=\frac{h_i}{h_o}$ ,

where

- $M$ is the ratio of the image size to the object size;
- $d_o$ is the distance of object, $[m]$;
- $d_i$ is the distance of image, $[m]$;
- $h_o$ is the height of object, $[m]$;
- $h_i$ is the height of image, $[m]$.
